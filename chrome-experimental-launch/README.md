# Chrome experimental

To test this library on some platforms you will need to launch chrome with the
[`Experimental Web Platform features`](chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features) flag enabled.

This folder contains a patch file so that `flutter run -d chrome` will launch a chrome instance with this flag enabled.
To enable this feature, first run the patch.

Copy the `Add-experimental-launch-flag.patch` file into the flutter folder. The file tree of the flutter folder should
look something like this:

```text
flutter/
 |-bin/
 |-dev/
 |-examples/
 |-packages/
 |-.git/
 |-.github/
 |-AUTHORS
 |-CODEOWNERS
 |-CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
 |-...
```

Now that the file is in the flutter folder we need to apply the patch.

```bash
patch -p1 < Add-experimental-launch-flag.patch
```

After patching, you can verify with running `git diff`. The contents of git diff should look the same as the content of
the `Add-experimental-launch-flag.patch` file.

Now we have to clear the snapshot cache so that flutter will rebuild the next time you run it and the changes will take
effect.

to do this delete the `bin/cache/flutter_tools.snapshot` file.

## Windows

This patch also works on Windows to launch browsers with the experimental flag enabled.
However, Windows doesn't have the patch command. You could install patch from other sources, or even just apply the 
patch manually. My preference is to use WSL and just use the linux patch command.

To do this open bash on Windows and cd into the same folder as the other steps above.

Now because the patch was made on Linux and not Windows it doesn't like the different line endings that Windows has as
compared to Linux. So use the following command instead to apply the patch.

```bash
patch -p1 --binary < Add-experimental-launch-flag.patch
```

Now continue with the steps as in the original steps of checking the `git diff` and removing the
`bin/cache/flutter_tools.snapshot` file.

## Versions:

This patch was originally written for Flutter 2.0.4.

Also, works with dart version (flutter version):
 - 2.0.5
 - 2.2.0
 - 2.8.1
 - 3.0.1
 - 3.3.0
 - 3.3.8
 - 3.5.3 (3.24.3)

The versions in between will probably also work. If a future version of flutter breaks the compatibility then please
open up an issue.

# Running as a webserver

Another option is using `flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8080`. And then opening your normal Chrome browser where
you have already enabled the experimental flag.

If you want to combine this with VS-Code. Then check out this issue more detailed steps: [#97](https://github.com/jeroen1602/flutter_web_bluetooth/issues/97)
